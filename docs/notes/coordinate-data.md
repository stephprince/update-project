## notes on electrophysiology coordinate confirmation with DiI

For all recordings, on the last day of recording from a cranio, the probe was dipped in DiI and inserted into the brain to confirm coordinates. These brains were then sliced
on a vibratome, mounted with DAPI to visualize the neural architecture, and then imaged on the confocal microscope. For some animals, there were issues during this process.
Any details are noted below. The coordinate notes can be found with the image data.

# S17
No issues reported.

# S20
The laser on the confocal was having problems so it had to be turned up to a very high power. This visualization might not be the best.

# S28
This brain was damaged on one hemisphere during the dissection process. The brain was then drop-fixed with 4% PFA for 48-72 hours, but when examined it seemed that the 
fixing process had not fully occurred. Not sure if it was the PFA or the damaged hemisphere or something else. The brain was re-fixed for 48 hours with new PFA, but this
seemed to maybe be too fixed? Either way, there were severe difficulties in cutting the tissue and the data was lost for this brain.

This brain was drop-fixed with 4% PFA for 48-72 hours, but when examined it seemed that the fixing process had not fully occurred. Not sure if it was the PFA or what. The brain
was re-fixed for 48 hours with new PFA, but this seemed to maybe be too fixed? Either way, there were severe difficulties in cutting the tissue and the data was lost for the 
PFC coordinates for this brain.
